This repository contains implementation of "Standard" ML Algorithms using only the Numpy library (nplearn) and tutorials in Jupyter Notebook with sample data. 

The codes shown here are meant to be a resources for anyone looking to learn or review concepts and implementation of these algorithms, and is not optimized for run time. If you like these tutorial, please start this repository and share. Thanks, Jason
