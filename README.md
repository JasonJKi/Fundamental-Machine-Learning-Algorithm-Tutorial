# Standard Machine Learning Algorithm Tutorials
This repository contains implementation of "fundamental" ML algorithms using only the Numpy library. The algorithms in this repository are covered in introductory ML courses, and they are commonly asked during interviews for data science and machine learning engineering roles in industry. The Jupyter Notebooks details a step-by-step breakdown of each algorithm with visualization using randomly generated data as well as some popular real-world data [data/].    

The codes shown here are meant to be a resources for anyone looking to learn or review concepts and implementation of these algorithms, and is not optimized for run time. If you like these tutorial, please start this repository and share. Thanks, Jason
